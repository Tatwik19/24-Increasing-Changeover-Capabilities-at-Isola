# 24-Increasing-Changeover-Capabilities-at-Isola
The Isola Group is a global company that services the manufacturing industry by producing and supplying a range of products and raw materials. Their Chandler plant is designed specifically to produce copper-fiberglass laminate for PCBs, with a focus on high-speed turnaround low-volume custom substrate. Isola has identified the current copper foil roll changeover solution on their assembly line as a bottleneck. It is currently a slow, partially manual process, and speeding up this portion of the assembly line would allow them to take on more next-day clients, fill more orders, and generate more value. Team 24 has been tasked with designing a solution that can decrease the copper foil changeover time and remove the bottleneck in their line. The deliverables consist of a detailed mechanical and electrical design, a bill of materials (BOM) of the completed solution, and a budget for a completed solution. The solutionâ€™s scope is limited to the beginning of the process at the copper foil pallet staged at the machine and ending with loading the copper foil rolls onto the existing chucks.
